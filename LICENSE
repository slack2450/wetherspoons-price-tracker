Written Under the Influence License
Version 1.0 - Because I was drunk when I wrote this

All rights... but honestly, who cares?

1. Permission to do whatever the fuck you want
I wrote this code while under the influence of more beers than I care to admit. You can do whatever the hell you want with it. Seriously, I can barely remember writing it, so if it blows up in your face, don’t come crying to bitching.

2. You’re on your own
If this thing breaks, burns, or accidentally summons a robot apocalypse, it’s not my fault. In fact, I don’t even know how it works. I probably got distracted halfway through and left some bugs for you to find. You’re welcome, I guess?

3. No warranty whatsoever
I’m pretty sure I don’t owe you anything. There’s no warranty here, not even the “It might work on Tuesdays” kind. If this project somehow catches fire and burns down your house, don’t blame me. I was literally drunk when I wrote this.

4. Make money off this? Go for it, I guess?
If you somehow make a metric shit load of cash off this mess, I’ll take a drink in your honor. No, seriously, I’m fine with that. Just don’t expect me to be any part of it, or remember what the hell this code is about in the first place. It’s yours now. Do whatever. Maybe buy me a bottle or something?

5. Modifications? Fork it, break it, do what you like.
You can fork it, modify it, break it, or whatever other weird shit you do with code. But if you somehow make this code worse (which honestly, is a feat considering the state it’s in), don’t expect me to fix it. You're on your own

6. Attribution? Whatever.
If you want to credit me as the mastermind behind this disaster, feel free. But to be honest, I was probably too hammered to even care when I slapped my name on it. Just put something in there and move on. Let's be honest no one’s going to read it anyway.

Final Disclaimer
If, by some miracle, this code actually works, great job. If it doesn’t, tough shit. I’ve moved on to more important things, like figuring out where my last drink went. Use it, break it, or completely ignore it. I really couldn’t care less. I was shitfaced when I wrote this, and I’m probably still merry right now.

End of License, I'm off to the pub <3
