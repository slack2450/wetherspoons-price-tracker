# Wetherspoons price tracker üçª\

## This API is working as of May 22nd (with caveats)

This repository contains the code for some AWS Lambda functions to track the price of every drink in every Wetherspoons pub.

This repo also contains a very simple lib in the `lib/` folder

## The caveats:

- It currently doesn't have a way to track the special Ale's name please see [this issue](https://github.com/slack2450/wetherspoons-price-tracker/issues/1) for more details
